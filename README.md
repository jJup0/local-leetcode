## Alternatives

Here are some alternatives I discovered halfway through the project:

- [LeetCode VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeetCode.vscode-leetcode)
- [leetcode cli](https://github.com/skygragon/leetcode-cli)
- [LeetScrape](https://github.com/nikhil-ravi/LeetScrape)
  - written in python
  - seems to have the most functionality out of all repos, there is even a compatible nextjs webgui
  - con: I could not even get any CLI commands to run, there seems to be a problem querying <https://leetcode.com/api/problems/all/>.
- [leet-scrape](https://github.com/krispykalsi/leet-scrape/)
  - written in go
  - seems to have to have good functionality, I have not tried it
- [Leetcode-Questions-Scraper](https://github.com/Bishalsarang/Leetcode-Questions-Scraper)
  - written in Python
  - old repo, seems to no longer be maintained
  - based on selenium
- [leetcode-local-environment](https://github.com/smarttommyau/leetcode-local-environment)
  - Mainly for support of special datastructures like TreeNode and ListNode, only for c++
- [LeetCodeLocally](https://github.com/superaghu/LeetCodeLocally)
  - written in java
- [leetcode](https://github.com/zhaoguanchen/leetcode)
  - written in java
  - main focus seems to be support for special datastructures
