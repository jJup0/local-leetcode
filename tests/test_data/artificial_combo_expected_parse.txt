Text before ul
- An item
- Some text
  - a very long piece of that should be appropriately indented on the second
    line in case of an overflow, which will happen
- More items
- There should be an empty line here vvvv

Text before ol
1. First item
  1. what about nested <li>s? no bothering for now. But I still want to check
     the indentation for overflow
2. Two but this time it is also very long, I just want to make sure that the
   indentation is ok
3. Three
4. Four
5. Five
6. Six
7. Seven
8. Eight
9. Nine
10. Ten: I am not handling overflow for two digit list items either, this edge
   case is too rare. Now that I think about it there has to be a good library for
   this somewhere.
